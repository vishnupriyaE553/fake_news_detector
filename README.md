# Project Title: Fake News Detection App

# Description:
I developed a Fake News Detection System using Python, VS Code, and Streamlit. This application allows users to input a news headline or article, and it predicts whether the news is real or fake. The model was trained using a labeled dataset of news articles and employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as text preprocessing, tokenization, and TF-IDF vectorization. A machine learning algorithm (like Logistic Regression or PassiveAggressiveClassifier) was then used to classify the news.

The Streamlit interface provides an easy-to-use and interactive web app where users can paste text, click a button, and instantly get a result indicating the authenticity of the news.
